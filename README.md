This repository contains the code and data for using unsupervised machine learning approaches (K-means, hierarchical clustering, SOM, DBSCAN) to cluster the human assumed central sensitization (HACS) related subgroups in Dutch-speaking population with chronic low back pain (CLBP) as presented in [Establishing Central Sensitization Inventory Cut-off Values in patients with Chronic Low Back Pain by Unsupervised Machine Learning](
